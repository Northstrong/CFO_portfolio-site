    <p>Rolex is more than a watch brand — it is a global symbol of luxury, status, and precision. Since its founding in 1905, Rolex has led the way in watchmaking innovation. From the world’s first waterproof wristwatch (the Oyster) to the development of the perpetual rotor mechanism, the brand consistently pushes the limits of craftsmanship.</p>
    <p>Collectors admire Rolex not just for the engineering, but also for the brand’s rich history and enduring models like the Submariner, Daytona, and Datejust. These timepieces have adorned the wrists of explorers, athletes, and world leaders, contributing to the brand’s legendary status.</p>
    <p>Investing in a Rolex often means buying a piece of history — one that holds or increases in value over time.</p>
