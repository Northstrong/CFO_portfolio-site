    <p>Audemars Piguet, founded in 1875, remains one of the last major watchmakers still owned by its founding families. The brand is synonymous with craftsmanship and complexity, producing watches entirely in-house in the Vallée de Joux, Switzerland.</p>
    <p>The iconic Royal Oak, introduced in 1972, revolutionized luxury sports watches with its octagonal bezel and integrated bracelet. Today, the Royal Oak and its variations continue to set trends in both aesthetics and mechanical ingenuity.</p>
    <p>For serious collectors, AP watches represent the pinnacle of design, exclusivity, and technical achievement.</p>
